# Cache Decorator

The cache decorator wraps a function and stores results in a configured storage, keyed by a deterministic cache key. Use it when you want per-function memoization with TTL, LRU, and dogâ€‘piling prevention.

When to use:
- You need function-level caching inside a process (sync or async).
- You want TTL-based staleness control and LRU eviction.
- You want to avoid thundering herds via per-key locks.

Common parameters:
- storage: callable returning the storage instance (TTLMapStorage for sync, TTLMapAsyncStorage for async).
- key_builder: optional callable returning a KeyBuilder to customize how keys are built (which args participate, serialization, prefixes, etc.).
